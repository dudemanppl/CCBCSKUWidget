# CC/BC SKU Widget

## Description

Browser extension made for use on the Competitive Cyclist and Backcountry websites to be able to quickly copy item SKUs to the clipboard.

Only tested with Chrome so far, so good luck. I'll publish it when its more polished. Email me at tliao@backcountry.com if you have any concerns.
